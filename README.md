## Project Proposal
- UGA Nvite (An event app that coordinates UGA students with similar interests)
Have you ever wanted to go a concert or sporting event but are unable to rally enough friends to join you? Forget your lame friends! UGA Nvite provides you with a platform to sign up for events with other sensible people. What makes UGA Nvite different? You don’t have to know anyone. Just have a genuine interest in attending an event of your choice and you’ll join a small group (usually between 4-6) of college students (enough to where it isn’t a date, but that you’ll still be a vital member of the group). 
### User Account Login Page 
- Provide users with a portal to login to their account with appropriate username/password fields.
- Provide users the ability to create a new account. New accounts require a username, password, phone number, and email to complete the account registration.
- Must login to an account in order to proceed past the homepage.
- New users will be added to a database table containing a list of site users.
### Available Events Page 
- Contains a list of upcoming events that the user can sign up for.
- Each event is stored in a table record and contains the name of the event, a short description (if available/applicable), the date of the event, the location of the event, and how many users are signed up for the event.
- Events are gathered from a variety of websites and combined into one timeline.
- Events are scrollable and will gather more events when the user reaches the bottom of the list.
- Events will fill up and become unavailable after the maximum number of attendees is reached.
- Events can be sorted in different ways by the user, but the default is to be ordered by date with the most recent upcoming events at the top of the list.
- Under an events page there will be an option to join a random group or to form a new group with a specific maximum size.
### My Events Page 
- Contains a list of upcoming events that the user is currently signed up for.
- Shows the user other members that are signed up for the same event and provides contact information (Phone number and/or Email) of each member.
- Shows a list of past events that the user has attended along with the group you attended the event with. You will be able to submit reviews (out of 5 stars) of the members of the group you attended with as well.
- Event Review Page 
- Gives users the ability to write reviews about their experience at X event and rate it out of 5 stars.
- Shows a list of reviews completed by other users for past events.
- Each user will also have a user rating (out of 5 stars) displayed next to their name.
